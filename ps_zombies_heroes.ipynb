HDZG Model: Heros, Consultants, Zombie/customer Eradication, Learning and Public Awareness
The below script has been written with the purpose of modeling the rates at which Consultants, Active JS, Customers, Churn and Survival Probability
change over the span of a PS zombie apocolypse. In this case we have accounted for Consultants learning to handle Jumpstarts, teach one another and the possibility of heroes. 
These rates of change have been defined by the 5 ODEs given in the brief and defined in the function "f" below. 
This script will also allow the inital values for each of these classes to be changed and therefore give the user the opportunity 
to observe how changing these initial values will effect each class's outcome during the apocalypse. 
This model is a slightly more complex model which consists of 5 classes: 
Consultants(Living), Active JS(Possibility of Ressurection), Customers(Living-Dead), Human Survival Possibility and Churn(No Return) which are governed by the 5 ODEs
    Consultants'=b*Hi-d*Hi-(1-hwi)*Hi*Zi #Formula for H'
    Active'=d*Hi+(1-hwi)*Hi*Zi-res*Di-dec*Di #Formula for D'
    Customers'=(res*Di)-(hwi*Hi*Zi)-(e*Hi*(Zi**0.5)) #Formula for Z'
    Churn'=dec*Di+hwi*Hi*Zi+e*Hi*(Zi**0.5) #Formula for G'
    Human Survival Probability=((l*hwi*((1-hwi)**0.5))*Hi*Zi)-(ldec*hwi)+(lteach*(1-hwi))  
    
This Script uses Scipy's ODEint function in order to solve the given equations with given initial values.
The values on lines below can be edited in order to model a different beginning case(e.g. More or less powerful human heros)
The perc function is used to get value per unit time. It reutrns the inputted value (intre) divided by the time inputted(time).
In this case all values are given per annum or diem and there for time inputted is either 365.25(a year) or 1(a day)
